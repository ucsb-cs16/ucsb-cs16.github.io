Here are some Vim commands that are not essential but useful in increasing your productivity (and possibly maintaining your sanity).

# 0. Copy and paste

You gotta learn these three things first.

## a. The 'yy' command

## b. Visual-block mode


## c. Visual-line mode


## 1. The `w` and `v` command



# 2. The `r` command
While you're in the command mode, you can replace any letter you have highlighted over the cursor by pressing `r` and the letter you want to be replaced with.

# 3. The `%` command
Sometimes you may want to transition between brackets. You can do the `%` command, to put your cursor rapidly between the left and right bracket. This will work for `{}`, `[]`, and `()`.

# 4. Deleting lines/cut and paste
The `dd` command can be used to delete the entire line the cursor is at.

If you add a number, say `5dd` in front of the `dd` command, it deletes the number of lines you specified starting from the line at the cursor.

Alternatively, `dd` behaves similar to `cut`, so you can use `dd` and `p` to cut and paste lines.

# 5. search/replace 


# 6. show line numbers


# 7. goto a line number


# 8. save as
