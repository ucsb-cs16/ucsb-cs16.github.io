If you have VSCode (or any other editor that you really like) installed on your own machine, but want to use it to edit files on CSIL, one way you can do that is to mount your CSIL Home directory *as if* it were a disk connected to your computer (i.e. mount it as a *network drive*.

The software used to do that is called *Samba*.

For an explanation of how to do it, see this article: <https://doc.engr.ucsb.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3342386>
