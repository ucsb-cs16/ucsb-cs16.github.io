Lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8.  They provide a much cleaner syntax than previous Java versions for the solution to 
several common programming tasks in Java. Here are some examples

* writing a custom sort for an `ArrayList` of objects (or any `Collection` of objects)
* writing event handlers for Swing GUIs
* writing event handlers for web applications
