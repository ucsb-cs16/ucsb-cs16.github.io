We use github.com organizations such as <https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-f16> and <https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-w17> to set up a space
on github.com where every repo that you create can automatically be seen by your instructors and TAs without you having to add them manually as collaborators.

To create a private repo for a C++ assignment on github.com, follow this procedure.

# Choosing a name

* Unless you are told otherwise, the naming convention is `labxx_githubusername`
* For example, `lab00_jgaucho`

Use EXACTLY that name, because that will be how your TAs find it to give you a grade.    

If you don't use the right letters, punctuation, capitalization, etc. it makes your TAs life more difficult. Your TA 
may therefore decide to make your life difficult by giving you a lower grade for "not following directions". 
They will have my full support.                         

# Filling in the rest

-   Under description, you may write anything you like, within reason.                           
    -   For example, something like "lab00 for Joe Schmoe" (if your name is Joe Schmoe) would be reasonable.                                                                                     
-   Select "private".                                                                            
-   Check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README.                           
    -   This is important because if you don't do this, the repo may have no content, and you can't clone a repo with no content.
-   Click the pull-down menu for "Add .gitignore" and select C++

Then create the repo.
