There are a lot of useful tools that you can use at the Unix command line.  

Many of these will also work on Mac with [Homebrew](mac_homebrew) or Windows with (windows_cygwin).

Not all of these are installed on every system.   So, as they say, YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary).

Here's a list, then detailed descriptions for some of them.

# List of tools

* `pandoc`: convert between various document formats (Markdown, MediaWiki, LaTeX, HTML, etc.)
* `convert`: the command line tool for Image-Magick.  Resize or convert between image formats (.png, .jpg, .gif, etc.).  Produce thumbnails, or resize a huge library of images to all the same width or height with a simple shell script.
* [`wkhtmltopdf`](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/): convert HTML to PDF at the command line.  Runs headless with no browser, and no GUI needed.
